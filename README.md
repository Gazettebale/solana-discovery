## 🎯 The Problem

New users trying to explore Solana face:
- **Information overload** — 165+ dApps on the Seeker dApp Store alone
- **Confusing onboarding** — No clear path to get started
- **No guidance** — Which apps to try first? What rewards are available?

## 💡 The Solution

**SolQuest** is a mobile-first discovery app built for Solana Seeker that helps users:
- **Swipe** through curated Solana projects and Seeker dApp Store apps
- **Save** the ones they want to explore
- **Track** their discovery progress
- **Learn** about DeFi, Staking, NFTs, DePIN, Gaming & more

Think of it as **Tinder for Solana dApps** — swipe right to explore, left to skip.

## 📱 Features

- 📱 **Seeker dApp Store Integration** — Highlights apps available on the Solana dApp Store
- 📌 **Saved Projects** — Keep track of projects you want to try
